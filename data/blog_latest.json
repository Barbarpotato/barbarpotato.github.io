    "short_description": "What if your AI assistant could do exactly what you need it to—like count words in a sentence, fetch live data, or even control smart devices—without waiting for the developers to add those features? That’s where the Model Context Protocol (MCP) comes in. It’s a powerful new framework from Anthropic that lets you extend AI models like Claude with custom tools you build yourself. In this blog, I’ll break down the concept of MCP, share how I used it to create a simple word-counting tool for Claude Desktop, and explore why this technology is so exciting for the future of AI.",
