The project involves creating a data pipeline where information from various sources is extracted, preprocessed, and converted into vector embeddings using state-of-the-art models. These embeddings are stored in a specialized vector database, enabling efficient similarity searches. When a user submits a question, the system retrieves relevant data from the database, combines it with a generative model, and produces contextually accurate and insightful answers. This approach enhances the system’s ability to respond dynamically, leveraging both static knowledge and real-time external data.",

      "htmlContent": "This project is my research in my University. The goal is to offer insights into predicting TB spread in this region, which can be crucial for organizations addressing TB. The prediction is based on visualizations generated through the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. LSTM is a type of algorithm in artificial intelligence and machine learning designed to address both long-term and short-term memory challenges in sequential data or time series.The study utilizes time series data on TB cases in Makassar City from 2019 to 2023. This data is validated through the registration numbers of TB sufferers at the district and city levels. The data undergoes preprocessing before being used for training and testing the LSTM model. The model is then integrated into a website application developed for this research.The application is evaluated through various testing methods, including white-box testing, black-box testing, and feedback from relevant agencies that will utilize the application. The research aims to contribute to TB prevention and treatment in Makassar City by providing a predictive tool that aids in resource allocation, intervention planning, and more effective decision-making for public health authorities.",
