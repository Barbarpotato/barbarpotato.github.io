      "htmlContent": "This project offers tools to visualize complex data structures and dependencies as node-based graphs using React Flow. It aims to convert intricate code dependencies and data models into intuitive visual representations, simplifying understanding, memorization, and planning for future development. The system includes two main modules: the Dependency Flow Builder, which visualizes function dependencies and execution order from APIs, and the Model Builder, which generates node-edge models from structured data, such as Lindsey data. Both modules persist their output in localStorage and return data compatible with React Flow.\n\nThis visualization approach supports memorization by creating a mental map of relationships through spatial layout—such as placing main nodes centrally with dependencies above or below—and by clearly illustrating execution sequences (e.g., “calls #1”) to reduce cognitive load. It also enhances decision-making by exposing gaps or bottlenecks in the architecture, helping developers identify missing code, optimize execution order, and plan subsequent tasks. Designed with extensibility in mind, the localStorage-backed outputs enable incremental updates and seamless integration with a React Flow frontend.",

The prediction is based on visualizations generated through the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. LSTM is a type of algorithm in artificial intelligence and machine learning designed to address both long-term and short-term memory challenges in sequential data or time series.The study utilizes time series data on TB cases in Makassar City from 2019 to 2023. This data is validated through the registration numbers of TB sufferers at the district and city levels. The data undergoes preprocessing before being used for training and testing the LSTM model. The model is then integrated into a website application developed for this research.The application is evaluated through various testing methods, including white-box testing, black-box testing, and feedback from relevant agencies that will utilize the application. The research aims to contribute to TB prevention and treatment in Makassar City by providing a predictive tool that aids in resource allocation, intervention planning, and more effective decision-making for public health authorities.",
